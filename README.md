# pattern-in-string
A sample application that I built to help a friend. It finds repeated patterns (and how many times) in a input string

## Example
Input string `zf3kabxcde224lkzf3mabxc51+crsdtzf3nab=` with pattern length of 3. Result should be:

> Found 'zf3' 3 times
> Found 'abx' 2 times
> Found 'bxc' 2 times
